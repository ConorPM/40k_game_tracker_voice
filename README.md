# 40k_game_tracker_voice
A voice controlled tracker for games of 9th edition Warhammer 40,000


Early stages, getting a working prototype and then I will probably switch to Picovoice for speech functions.
Still need to figure out the best method for storing game results, probably a sqlite database.
